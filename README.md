##Decoded message:

 send a message to rose with the word jinker and your team name to get the next clue

##Thing to note
 The programs output may vary as there is more than one possible mapping in which all 18 words in the cyphered text
 are words from the dictionary.
 
 Other possible mappings: 
 * send a message to rose with the word jinker and your team name to get the next blue
 * send a message to rose with the word jinker and four team name to get the next clue
 * send a message to rose with the word jinker and four team name to get the next blue
 
 Of course if we would take out words "four" and "blue" out of the dictionary the program uses, the program would return the
  correct output 100% of times. However we choose not to as this would tamper with programs ability to break other cyphered messages.
  Furthermore, while out team know the context of this message and can be quite sure that for instance "qgpe" is "clue" and not "blue"
  the program can not be reasonably expected to know in what context the encoded message should be read so all the outputs are
  equally valid.
